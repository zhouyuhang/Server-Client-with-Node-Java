This is the Client/Server code program by Yuhang(Alex) Zhou
Server side is written in Node JS
Client side is written in JAVA

You can start from "run.bat", and run commands in the JAVA client side CMD.
I managed to build the connection between Server side and Client side with several functions.
Because I had some difficulty figuring out how to handle the parameter in the URL, I had made the simplification without the parameters,
only these JAVA commands are allowed:
testSites	getStatus	getResults	getAll	help
